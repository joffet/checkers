Checkers take-home challenge:

The goal of this exercise is to write a simple checkers game app, preferably using ReactJS. The minimal requirements are:

- Implement basic game mechanics: taking turns, basic moves and jumps over the enemy checkers.
- Players should be able to drag-n-drop checkers using a mouse. Additional ways to control the game are up to you.
- On mouse over checker, please highlight cells where a checker can possibly move to
- If there is an opportunity to capture an enemy checker - it should be the only valid move
- No-brain AI player: could make a move to any random valid cell
- Make sure that the app is stable across major browsers

The primary areas to focus are code readability, state management, and overall user experience. You may use any state management approach of your choice. Feel free to use any resources to assist in solving the problem (Google search, ChatGPT, documentation, etc.). Try to minimize the amount of external dependencies in your app. Ensure your app is documented. The quality of your submission should match what you would submit to your colleagues at work for code review and be comfortable to ship to production.

Suggested ways to stand out of the crowd:

- Unit tests
- TypeScript
- Better game stats UI (game time, number of moves, victory banners etc.)

The best way to stand out of the crowd is to find a particular part of the problem that you are interested in and do a deeper dive technically!
